What is it?
===============
This is a simple QT6 program that basically acts as a terminal viewer for embedded devices.

You know serial viewer programs exist, right?
=============================================
Yes, but this one is special because I made it. Also, it's meant to be as dumb as possible. Everything is on one screen 
and it doesn't have a lot of options. Most other programs are complicated to explain to people how to use. This one nearly cannot
be any simpler. You just give it a serial port and speed and say connect. The options are all tailored specifically
for our (EVTV) devices that have serial consoles. As such, maybe it isn't the ideal program for your uses. Or, maybe it is.

My mother could have written a crappy app like this!
====================================================
Yes, your mother is an intelligent and sweet woman. And, yes, this is coded really sloppy and quick. But, that's the point. 
It isn't a lot of code, it isn't very complicated. It never will be all that feature laden or complicated. Your mother
could use this app too. And, you could probably explain to your grandma how to use it (btw, tell her I said hi!)

How are you reading my mind?
============================
I have psychic mind powers.
